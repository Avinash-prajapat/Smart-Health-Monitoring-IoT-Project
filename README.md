# Smart Health Monitoring Dashboard (Frontend)

## Overview
This project implements a **web-based dashboard** for monitoring key health parameters. The dashboard is designed to display real-time data from sensors (or dummy data for testing) with animated alerts and status indicators.

## Features
- Display health parameters:
  - Body Temperature üå°Ô∏è
  - Heart Rate ‚ù§Ô∏è
  - Oxygen Level (SpO‚ÇÇ) ü´Å
  - Room Humidity üíß
  - Fall Detection üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Visual indicators for normal or critical conditions
- Animated emojis and hints for overall patient status
- Permanent bottom note for user guidance
- Fully responsive design for different screen sizes
- **Download & Print Patient Report (PDF/Text)** option available

## How to Run
Click the link to open the live dashboard: [Click here](https://avinash-prajapat.github.io/Smart-Health-Monitoring-IoT-Project/)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Currently uses **dummy values** for testing. Real-time integration with Arduino sensors can be done by connecting a backend API using Flask or Node.js.

## Notes for Real-Time Data
- The frontend is fully ready to display dynamic data from sensors.  
- JavaScript functions handle **condition checks** and **animated feedback** based on sensor values.  
- When integrating with Arduino:
  - Use serial communication to send sensor data to a backend (e.g., Flask API).  
  - The backend will serve the data via HTTP endpoints.  
  - Frontend will fetch data periodically and update the dashboard automatically.
